# [OpenBSD] 4.2 song release ...

本次的 OpenBSD song 听起来感觉不错，rap 风格浓郁，:-) 故事也挺有意思的。

The Race is there to be run, for ourselves, not for others. We do what we do to run our own race, and finish it the best we can. We don't rush off at every distraction, or worry how this will affect our image. We are here to have fun doing right.

自己的目标、自己的路，一路行来……
